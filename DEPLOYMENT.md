## 🔧 Environment Variables

If you need environment variables for your deployment:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 on Refresh**
   - ✅ Fixed with our redirect configurations in `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml`

2. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version (we specify v18)
   - Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`

3. **Domain Not Working**
   - DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours
   - Use [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation

4. **HTTPS Issues**
   - Both Vercel and Netlify provide automatic HTTPS
   - May take a few minutes to provision certificates
